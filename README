#xv6 operating system optimization

xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6, but is implemented for a modern x86-based multiprocessor using ANSI C.

In this repository we had 5 phases to reach the better version of xv6 operating system.

##phase 2 :
##phase 3 : Optimization of Scheduling Algorithm 
##phase 4 : 
##phase 5 :

##BUILDING AND RUNNING XV6
To build xv6 on an x86 ELF machine (like Linux or FreeBSD), run
"make". On non-x86 or non-ELF machines (like OS X, even on x86), you
will need to install a cross-compiler gcc suite capable of producing
x86 ELF binaries (see https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/).
Then run "make TOOLPREFIX=i386-jos-elf-". Now install the QEMU PC
simulator and run "make qemu".
